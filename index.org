I’m currently a first-year Ph.D. student at Department of Computer Science and Technology, [[http://www.nju.edu.cn/][Nanjing University]] and a member of [[http://tcs.nju.edu.cn][CS Theory Group]]. I’m advised by Professor [[http://tcs.nju.edu.cn/yinyt/Yitong_Yin_homepage.html][Yitong Yin]].

Before I joined Nanjing University, I obtained B.Eng. degree from [[http://www.uestc.edu.cn/][University of Electronic Science and Technology of China]] in June 2020, where I majored in Computer Science and Technology and was advised by Professor [[https://sites.google.com/site/myxiao/Home][Mingyu Xiao]] and Professor [[http://en.uestc.edu.cn/info/1074/2709.htm][Yi Zhou]]. In that period, I mainly focus on design and analysis exact exponential algorithms for optimization problems on graph such as maximum weighted independent set or maximum relaxed cliques.

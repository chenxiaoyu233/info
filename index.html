      <p>
        I'm currently a second-year Ph.D. student at the Department of Computer Science and Technology,
        <a href="http://www.nju.edu.cn/">Nanjing University</a>, and a member of <a href="http://tcs.nju.edu.cn">CS
          Theory Group</a>. I'm advised by Professor <a
          href="http://tcs.nju.edu.cn/yinyt/Yitong_Yin_homepage.html">Yitong Yin</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before I joined Nanjing University, I obtained B.Eng. degree from <a href="http://www.uestc.edu.cn/">UESTC</a> in June 2020, where I was adviced by Prof. <a href = "https://sites.google.com/site/myxiao/Home">Mingyu Xiao</a> and Dr. <a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/yi-zhou">Yi Zhou</a>.

      <p>
        I'm interested in theoretical computer science.
        Currently, I focus on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which are widely used for approximate sampling and
        counting.

Using our technique, we could boost the good results obtained by combinatorics techniques (such as coupling) to an extreme regime where these techniques can not apply directly. Hence, we obtain the first \\(f(\\delta) \\cdot \\mathrm{poly}(n)\\) type of mixing time for Glauber dynamics on anti-ferro \\(2\\)-spin systems, where \\(\\delta\\) is used to measure the "hardness" of the instance.'

We extend the reduction and branching rules from the original maximum independent set problem to the weighted version and use "measure-and-conquer" to analyze the branching process. To make things simple, we mainly consider the case where the average degree is bounded by \\(3\\). Currently, we obtained the best asymptotic running time in this case.'

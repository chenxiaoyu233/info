      <p>
        I'm currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student at the Department of Computer Science and Technology,
        <a href="http://www.nju.edu.cn/">Nanjing University</a>, and a member of <a href="http://tcs.nju.edu.cn">CS
          Theory Group</a>. I'm advised by Professor <a
          href="http://tcs.nju.edu.cn/yinyt/Yitong_Yin_homepage.html">Yitong Yin</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before I joined Nanjing University, I obtained B.Eng. degree from <a href="http://www.uestc.edu.cn/">University of Electronic Science and Technology of China</a> in June 2020, where I was adviced by Prof. <a href = "https://sites.google.com/site/myxiao/Home">Mingyu Xiao</a> and Dr. <a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/yi-zhou">Yi Zhou</a>.

      <p>
        I'm interested in theoretical computer science.
        Currently, I focus on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which are widely used for approximate sampling and
        counting.
